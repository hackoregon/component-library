OK OK OK

You got the LeafletMap element to render!  Just from poking around!  Good job!!

What's next?

Assignment is to:
  - get the map to render portland
  - have tests passing
  - maybe pass data in to the map through props

So!  Let's break that down.

First priority is getting the map to render.  Getting it to render PDX shouldn't be a huge issue since it's just a lat and long thatcha just slap right on in there.  Just, mm.  Hardcoded.

Try playing around some more with the LeafletMap story, and compare it to Button and StoryCard.  Those are good.

Just see how it's already been done, then try to imitate it.  Easy peasy, just takes focus and time.

You can do this! ðŸŽ‰

Yeah yeah yeah map is rendering.  Now what?

Whelp, gotta get some tests going.  Proooobably should've done that first but fuck it we're learning here.

SO!  Testing!  Check out Button.test.js and mimic it, I guess.

LATER we'll work on passing props.  Doesn't look too bad.
